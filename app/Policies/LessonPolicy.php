/**
 * S6 eligibility (scope §8):
 *
 * - Publication is checked by the controllers first: draft, archived, or
 *   otherwise unpublished content is a 404 for everyone, including staff.
 * - A published lesson of a published topic is viewable when it is flagged
 *   as the public sample, when the user is active staff (panel preview),
 *   or when the user holds an eligible subscription window
 *   (SubscriptionAccess: not disabled, not revoked, starts_at <= now <
 *   expires_at). Level is content, never a permission: every published
 *   level is allowed to an eligible subscriber.
 * - Pending grants nothing; expired, revoked, and suspended accounts are
 *   denied on the next request.
