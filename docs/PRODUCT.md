# Fast English — Product Contract

Source baseline: `docs/FAST_ENGLISH_BUILD_SCOPE_FA.md` v1.0 (2026-10-07). It is the authority after the latest explicit owner instruction. Section numbers below refer to that scope (`§`). Do not reconstruct scope from memory; read the scope file for detail.

Authority order: latest explicit owner instruction → accepted slice contract → scope + recorded fresh decisions → repository docs. Conflicting behaviors are never both planned as valid (see conflict log in the active exec plan).

## Product outcome

Mobile-first Persian-RTL web product where learners pick a short English article at a CEFR level, read it, and listen to the matching audio (scope §1). Brand working name: Fast English; final brand, domain ownership, prices, bank destination, legal text, SMTP, signing identity, hosting, staff roster, and content production are launch-only inputs (§25) and block only their own launch boundary. Development continues with clearly labelled fixtures.

Reference domain in scope documents: `fastenglishpodcast.com` — ownership/access to be verified before launch (§25). No product code exists in this checkout; this is a fresh rebuild.

Core journeys (§1, §7): (1) see a real sample before paying; (2) pick topic + level; (3) read text + hear the same version; (4) see a small set of key words; (5) resume from saved position. Revenue path: account → plan → transfer info → off-app card transfer → receipt → staff review → subscription active.

## Level semantics (binding rule)

A level is a **content attribute, not an access permission** (scope §8). All published A1–C2 versions are allowed to an eligible subscriber. Level values are fixed: `A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2`; at most one lesson per (topic, level). Missing level shows "این سطح هنوز آماده نیست" with available levels — no silent substitution (§7.2). Browsing a level never silently changes `preferred_level`; changing it requires explicit settings/placement-accept action (§12, §15). Placement is optional and never gates signup, sample, or subscriber use (§12).

## Access and money rules (summary; owners in ARCHITECTURE.md)

- Eligibility (server-computed, §8): `eligible = user exists AND disabled_at IS NULL AND subscription.revoked_at IS NULL AND starts_at <= now_utc < expires_at`. Derived labels (active/expired/pending/rejected) are display-only; no parallel `account_status` on users.
- Public sample allowed only when topic AND lesson are published AND `is_public_sample=true` (§8). Premium body/glossary/audio never sent to ineligible clients, including Livewire payloads (§7.1).
- Money is integer toman; no float, no ambiguous rial/toman conversion (§8). Plan durations are exact days, not calendar months. Timestamps stored UTC, displayed Asia/Tehran.
- Payment snapshot is taken **before** transfer from the active plan/destination (plan name, price, days, card number, holder, bank) and is immutable for that request (§10.2). Client supplies only plan ID.
- One open (`awaiting_receipt`/`pending`) request per user, enforced by partial unique index + server rule (§10.1, §14). Pending grants no new access.
- Approval is one shared transactional action with fixed lock order (User → PaymentRequest → Subscription), idempotent replay, and `subscription_events.source_payment_request_id` unique (§11). Staff cannot approve their own request. Reject needs a public reason; cancelled/rejected history is preserved; resubmit creates a new request.

## Non-goals (scope §4 — binding, as amended 2026-10-09)

Bank gateway/bank API, auto/OCR receipt verification, SMS OTP, native iOS, store publishing, offline download of paid content, push, AI tutor, speaking, runtime AI/TTS, full lesson translation, word-level alignment, public import pipeline, chart dashboard, streaks/leaderboards/achievements, algorithmic recommender, coupons, affiliates, multi-teacher, multi-locale UI. Sentence-level cues (READ-03), the vocabulary notebook with simple SRS (VOCAB-01), and the daily learning path (PLAN-01) are IN scope since the 2026-10-09 owner request below. No standalone stats page (progress lives on lesson + Today/continue surfaces). Cooperation/support start as info pages/links; no internal CRM/ticketing. Items enter only via explicit scope change + new acceptance criteria.

## Owner-approved amendments 2026-10-09 (authoritative per scope §0; save-only, no behavior built this turn)

1. Dark mode into v1 (removes `dark mode` from the §4 exclusion above). Light is the default; user chooses system, light, or dark. Reason: owner requires dark alongside light for parity with leading consumer audio/learning apps.
2. Scope §17.1 restraint relaxed, narrowly: gradients/glow only in cover art + landing hero; motion only for state feedback/transitions with `prefers-reduced-motion`; shadows only via named elevation tokens. Reason: owner requires polished/distinctive finish.
3. Navigation to mobile bottom tab bar (Library, Saved, Account) with mini-player above + safe-area padding; supersedes top-bar placement (scope §17.3 already assumes this). Reason: mobile audio-app pattern + polish.
4. Every published topic shows a real cover: default generated abstract cover (GD, deterministic from slug, no baked text); staff may upload licensed photos each with a license record (source, license name, date checked, usage notes); no runtime third-party fetch. Reason: owner forbids empty placeholders; provenance must be auditable.
5. Amber replaces the navy/blue identity from scope §17.1 (primary `#1D4ED8`, primary-hover `#1E40AF`) with the Night Studio amber scale (dark `#F5A524`, light `#B45309`, sepia `#92400E`); navy/blue is no longer the identity. Owner-approved on 2026-10-09 by owner direction. Reason: owner direction requires a distinctive polished palette with a warm amber signal for play/progress.
6. Soft Day light theme (owner Softly inspiration, 2026-10-09) replaces the Night Studio light table and the §17.1 proposal values in code for learner app surfaces (canvas `#FDFCF8`, coral `#FFB7B2`/`#FF9E99`, text `#292524`, muted `#78716C`); sage `#E8EFE8` recorded for landing; perf-heavy effects excluded; landing markup untouched. Owner-approved on 2026-10-09 by owner direction. Reason: owner wants the Softly look in the app without the perf cost.
7. Editorial redesign + three learning features into v1 (owner request 2026-10-09): (a) premium editorial visual identity from the supplied reference (warm ivory canvas, deep navy text, blue primary actions, warm amber accent; Vazirmatn Persian + Inter English; landing, Today «امروز», Discover «کشف مطالب», immersive reader, vocabulary «واژه‌ها», calm account, desktop sidebar + mobile four-tab nav «امروز/کشف/واژه‌ها/حساب»); (b) sentence-level immersive reading with real validated timing data and fallback (READ-03); (c) personal vocabulary notebook with deterministic Again/Hard/Good/Easy SRS (VOCAB-01); (d) personalized daily learning path with 5/10/15-minute goals derived from persisted progress (PLAN-01). Removes `flashcards/SRS` and `word-by-word highlight` from the §4 exclusion above in this narrow sense only: sentence-level sync is required, word-level alignment stays excluded; no third-party dictionary/translation/transcription/TTS API; streaks/leaderboards/achievements stay excluded. Reason: owner explicitly approved these three scope extensions and the reference visual direction.

## Measurement and operations

- Activation: a user with no in-person help views the sample, submits a payment request, and uses content after approval (§1).
- Staff independence: staff publishes a lesson and reviews a receipt without code edits (§1).
- Invariants: audio/text/progress never mixed across levels or users; duplicate/concurrent requests never double-apply subscription effect (§1).
- Budgets/targets: list paginated at 12 topics/page, no N+1, `preload=metadata`, no admin assets in learner bundle, real baseline measured in S0 (§20.2). Accessibility target WCAG 2.2 AA on main paths (functional target; full conformance claim needs an audit — see DESIGN.md).
- Telemetry: no product analytics dashboard in v1 (§4). Required ops signals: availability, 5xx, job/backup failure, disk space, pending-payment age (§19.2). No secrets, receipts, paid content, answer keys, or tokens in logs (§19.2).

## Open product decisions (pointers, not approvals)

All of §25 remains owner/Domain input at its launch boundary: stack confirmation, nav/placement confirmation, staff model, brand/logo/domain, package ID + signing owner, plans/prices, bank destination, snapshot-validity policy, staff SLA text, email/SMTP, placement questions + cut scores, pilot content (proposed 5 topics / ≥12 lessons covering all six levels + two-level sample), palette/fonts/assets, refund/privacy/retention policy, VPS/storage/backup destination, support channel, budget/deadline. Proposed defaults are labelled as proposals in DESIGN.md/PLAN.md and never presented as owner approval.
