# Fast English — Design Contract

Source: scope §17 (UI/UX), §6 (routes/nav), §7 (flows), §13 (player/progress). Scope §17.1 palette/typography values are **proposals, not owner approval**.

## Owner direction (confirmed)

- Calm, professional, adult, readable, editorial; visual focus on text, lesson image, and playback (§17.1).
- Mobile-first, single-column on mobile; reading measure ~680px on desktop (§17.1).
- Persian RTL chrome, English content LTR (scope §17.3).
- No admin-dashboard look in the learner surface (§17.1).
- No second frontend; learner styling is Tailwind 4.1+ with Flux Free only where needed + bespoke Blade (§2).

## Owner instruction 2026-10-09 (authoritative per scope §0 — save-only, no UI built this turn)

The product and landing must look polished, distinctive, and professional, comparable to leading consumer audio and learning apps. Dark mode is required alongside light mode. The palette must be distinctive. Every published topic must show a real cover image, not an empty placeholder.

## Owner-approved amendments 2026-10-09 (supersede cited scope text; reason recorded)

1. Dark mode into v1 (was scope §4 excluded). Full second theme alongside light. Light is the default; user can choose system, light, or dark. Reason: owner requires dark alongside light for parity with leading audio/learning apps.
2. Scope §17.1 restraint relaxed, narrowly. Gradients and glow allowed only in cover art and the landing hero. Motion allowed only for state feedback and transitions, and must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Shadows limited to named elevation tokens. Reason: owner requires polished/distinctive finish; prior blanket ban blocks cover/hero craft.
3. Navigation to mobile bottom tab bar: Library, Saved, Account; mini-player above it with safe-area padding. Supersedes top-bar placement. Scope §17.3 already assumes bottom nav/mini-player/safe-area. Reason: owner polish + audio-app pattern on mobile.
4. Covers for every published topic. Default is a generated abstract cover, rendered server-side with GD, deterministic from the topic slug, with no text baked into the image. Staff may upload licensed photos; each upload needs a license record: source, license name, date checked, usage notes. No image fetched from a third-party API at runtime. Reason: owner requires no empty placeholder; provenance must be auditable without runtime dependency.
5. Amber replaces the navy/blue identity from scope §17.1 (primary `#1D4ED8`, primary-hover `#1E40AF`) with the Night Studio amber scale (dark `#F5A524`, light `#B45309`, sepia `#92400E`); navy/blue is no longer the identity. Owner-approved on 2026-10-09 by owner direction. Reason: owner direction requires a distinctive polished palette with a warm amber signal for play/progress.
6. Soft Day light theme (owner Softly inspiration, 2026-10-09) replaces the Night Studio light table and the §17.1 proposal values in code for learner app surfaces: canvas `#FDFCF8`, surface `#FFFFFF`, text `#292524`, muted `#78716C`, coral primary `#FFB7B2`/hover `#FF9E99` with dark label `#292524`, divider `#E7E5E4`, input-boundary `#78716C`, lavender tint `#EFEDF4`; sage `#E8EFE8` recorded for landing. Performance-heavy effects explicitly excluded (no grain overlay, no backdrop-blur, no permanent/floating animation, no giant blurred blobs). Landing markup untouched. Owner-approved on 2026-10-09 by owner direction. Reason: owner wants the Softly look in the app without the perf cost.

## Owner-approved application palette 2026-10-10 — Modern Hybrid (APPROVED, canonical; supersedes Blue/Teal)

Explicit owner decision recorded before coding (owner inputs 2026-10-10): single package 299000 toman context aside, the app gets a full modern hybrid refresh — dark-bold Today/stats like hybrid-dark, light-soft Reader/Player like hybrid-light, editorial IA like fast-english-editorial (Today/Discover/Reader/Words/Account + landing hero + desktop sidebar + Vazirmatn FA + Inter EN + ivory #F7F5EF / navy #172238 / blue #4263EB / amber #E9AC52 as base). Both themes reuse the same `--fe-*` names in `resources/css/app.css :root[data-theme]`. The Blue/Teal tables below become history; no hex lives outside `:root` (locked by `tests/Feature/S3DesignTest.php` for BOTH themes).

Light (`:root[data-theme="light"]`) — every hex APPROVED 2026-10-10:

| Token | Hex (APPROVED) | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--fe-canvas` | `#f7f5ef` | ivory base: app canvas (editorial + hybrid-light) |
| `--fe-surface` | `#ffffff` | white 24px cards/bars/inputs (hybrid-light) |
| `--fe-text` | `#172238` | navy base: body |
| `--fe-muted-text` | `#5b6372` | secondary text (5.55:1 canvas, 6.05:1 surface) |
| `--fe-border` | `#e7dfd2` | warm hairline dividers only (decorative, never sole indicator) |
| `--fe-input-border` | `#5b6372` | input boundaries (reuses muted; 6.05:1) |
| `--fe-primary` | `#4263eb` | blue base: primary fills + active states + focus |
| `--fe-primary-hover` | `#364fc7` | hover/pressed fill (white label 6.77:1) |
| `--fe-on-primary` | `#ffffff` | label on primary/hover (4.98:1 / 6.77:1 PASS) |
| `--fe-secondary` | `#dde5fb` | blue tint: chips, cover tint (navy label 12.61:1) |
| `--fe-on-secondary` | `#172238` | label on secondary |
| `--fe-accent` | `#e9ac52` | amber base: ring + small highlights only (navy label 7.93:1; progress keeps primary blue in light for 4.98:1 visibility — amber-on-ivory 1.84:1 would fail) |
| `--fe-on-accent` | `#172238` | label on accent |
| `--fe-tint-lavender` | `#ede8d6` | warm cover tint (kept token name; navy text 12.94:1) |
| `--fe-success` | `#0f766e` | status text (with text/icon, never color-alone) |
| `--fe-danger` | `#be123c` | status text (with text/icon, never color-alone) |
| `--fe-elev-1/2` | named tokens only | restrained shadows (navy-tinted) |

Dark (`:root[data-theme="dark"]`) — every hex APPROVED 2026-10-10:

| Token | Hex (APPROVED) | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--fe-canvas` | `#0e1626` | deep navy-black canvas (hybrid-dark bold) |
| `--fe-surface` | `#172238` | navy base as card/bar surface |
| `--fe-text` | `#f7f5ef` | ivory base: body |
| `--fe-muted-text` | `#b9c4d0` | secondary text (10.22:1 canvas, 8.98:1 surface) |
| `--fe-border` | `#2a3a55` | navy divider (decorative, never sole indicator) |
| `--fe-input-border` | `#b9c4d0` | input boundaries (reuses muted; 8.98:1) |
| `--fe-primary` | `#8aa4ff` | blue lightened from #4263EB for dark legibility (navy label 6.68:1; 6.68:1 focus on surface) |
| `--fe-primary-hover` | `#a3b8ff` | hover fill (navy label 8.21:1) |
| `--fe-on-primary` | `#172238` | label on primary/hover |
| `--fe-secondary` | `#2a3a55` | navy fill: chips, dark fills (ivory label 10.50:1) |
| `--fe-on-secondary` | `#f7f5ef` | label on secondary |
| `--fe-accent` | `#e9ac52` | amber base: progress + ring + highlights (navy label 7.93:1; 7.93:1 on navy surface) |
| `--fe-on-accent` | `#172238` | label on accent |
| `--fe-tint-lavender` | `#232f45` | dark cover tint (same token name; ivory label 12.32:1) |
| `--fe-success` | `#2dd4bf` | status text (teal) |
| `--fe-danger` | `#fb7185` | status text (restrained coral) |
| `--fe-elev-1/2` | named tokens only | restrained shadows |

Mapping: ivory #F7F5EF → canvas/text per theme; navy #172238 → text/surface per theme; blue #4263EB → primary (light exact, dark lightened to #8AA4FF/#A3B8FF for 4.5:1 with navy label + 3:1 focus on navy surface); amber #E9AC52 → accent both themes (ring/highlights; progress keeps primary blue in light for visibility). Secondary/tint are blue/warm tints derived from the base (documented above). No other hues in components. Blue restraint: blue fills only on primary actions, active nav/level/speed states, and focus; amber only on ring/highlights (dark progress included); all other surfaces stay canvas/surface with hairline dividers — never a blue-card wall, never a KPI dashboard, never decorative charts.

Measured contrast (computed WCAG relative luminance, same method as S1/S3, 2026-10-10; locked by `tests/Feature/S3DesignTest.php` for BOTH themes): light — text/canvas 14.57:1, muted/canvas 5.55:1, text/surface 15.88:1, muted/surface 6.05:1, on-primary/primary 4.98:1, on-primary/hover 6.77:1, on-accent/accent 7.93:1, on-secondary/secondary 12.61:1, text/tint 12.94:1, success/surface 5.47:1, danger/surface 6.29:1; controls: input-border/surface 6.05:1, primary/surface 4.98:1 (focus/non-text PASS). Dark — text/canvas 16.58:1, muted/canvas 10.22:1, text/surface 14.57:1, muted/surface 8.98:1, on-primary/primary 6.68:1, on-primary/hover 8.21:1, on-accent/accent 7.93:1, on-secondary/secondary 10.50:1, text/tint 12.32:1, success/surface 8.53:1, danger/surface 5.90:1; controls: input-border/surface 8.98:1, primary/surface 6.68:1 (focus PASS). No failing pair waived; decorative dividers exempt and never sole indicators.

Spacing/type system (APPROVED): scale `--fe-space-1/2/3/4/5/6/8/12` (0.25–3rem); radius 20–24px cards (`1.25rem`), pills `999px`; measure `680px` reader, `1024px` wide narrative; titles `--fe-title-hero/page/section`; `.fe-display` condensed uppercase English display (hybrid-dark REPORTS/REVENUE/CATEGORIES, Persian keeps normal case); 44px minimum targets; safe-area insets on playerbar/bottomnav; end-padding `.fe-main-pad` 15rem collapsed / 24rem expanded so fixed bars never cover content; no h-scroll at 360/390/430/768/1440, reflow at 320. Motion ≤200ms (press/focus/player/reveal 180ms) + `prefers-reduced-motion` kill; no autoplay, no permanent animation, no gradient blobs/heavy blur. Type: Vazirmatn FA + Inter EN first with system fallback; reader 18–19px/1.8.

## Owner-approved application palette 2026-10-09 — Blue/Teal (SUPERSEDED 2026-10-10 by Modern Hybrid above; retained as history)

History only — superseded 2026-10-10. The two tables below are NOT canonical. Older palette proposals (Night Studio amber, Soft Day coral, Editorial Ivory navy/blue/amber, §17.1 navy) are superseded for the application UI and are retained above as history only. Landing markup is untouched; shared-token changes must not regress it (verified in browser).

Light (`:root[data-theme="light"]`) — every hex APPROVED:

| Token | Hex (APPROVED) | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--fe-canvas` | `#f5f9fa` | owner background: app canvas |
| `--fe-surface` | `#ffffff` | readable surface: cards/bars/inputs |
| `--fe-text` | `#0e171b` | owner text: body |
| `--fe-muted-text` | `#42565f` | secondary text (blue-slate, derived for harmony) |
| `--fe-border` | `#d9e6ed` | hairline dividers only (decorative, never sole indicator) |
| `--fe-input-border` | `#42565f` | input boundaries (reuses muted value; 7.70:1) |
| `--fe-primary` | `#4f95b5` | owner primary: fills + progress + focus |
| `--fe-primary-hover` | `#4589a8` | hover/pressed fill (dark label kept readable 4.66:1) |
| `--fe-on-primary` | `#0e171b` | label on primary/hover (dark ink — white 3.33:1 FAILS, dark 5.44:1 PASSES) |
| `--fe-secondary` | `#a3c9dc` | owner secondary: soft fills, cover tint, chips (dark label 10.32:1) |
| `--fe-on-secondary` | `#0e171b` | label on secondary |
| `--fe-accent` | `#6eaecf` | owner accent: progress, today ring, small highlights (dark label 7.45:1) |
| `--fe-on-accent` | `#0e171b` | label on accent |
| `--fe-tint-lavender` | `#e3eef4` | cover-placeholder tint (kept token name; remapped to secondary tint, text 15.39:1) |
| `--fe-success` | `#0f766e` | status text (with text/icon, never color-alone) |
| `--fe-danger` | `#b91c1c` | status text (with text/icon, never color-alone) |
| `--fe-elev-1/2` | named tokens only | restrained shadows |

Dark (`:root[data-theme="dark"]`) — every hex APPROVED:

| Token | Hex (APPROVED) | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--fe-canvas` | `#05090a` | owner background |
| `--fe-surface` | `#0d161b` | readable surface (slightly lifted ink) |
| `--fe-text` | `#e4edf1` | owner text |
| `--fe-muted-text` | `#9fb3bd` | secondary text (blue-gray) |
| `--fe-border` | `#23495c` | owner secondary reused as divider (decorative, never sole indicator) |
| `--fe-input-border` | `#9fb3bd` | input boundaries (reuses muted value; 8.41:1) |
| `--fe-primary` | `#4a90b0` | owner primary |
| `--fe-primary-hover` | `#6eaecf` | hover fill (reuses owner light accent; dark label 8.21:1) |
| `--fe-on-primary` | `#05090a` | label on primary/hover (deep ink — white 3.55:1 FAILS, ink 5.63:1 PASSES) |
| `--fe-secondary` | `#23495c` | owner secondary: chips, dividers, dark fills (light label 8.11:1) |
| `--fe-on-secondary` | `#e4edf1` | label on secondary |
| `--fe-accent` | `#307191` | owner accent: progress + ring (white label 5.39:1; ink 3.71:1 FAILS so label is white) |
| `--fe-on-accent` | `#ffffff` | label on accent |
| `--fe-tint-lavender` | `#23495c` | cover tint (same token name; light label 8.11:1) |
| `--fe-success` | `#2dd4bf` | status text (teal) |
| `--fe-danger` | `#fb7185` | status text (restrained coral) |
| `--fe-elev-1/2` | named tokens only | restrained shadows |

Mapping: owner background→`--fe-canvas`, owner text→`--fe-text`, owner primary→`--fe-primary` (+ derived hover with readable label), owner secondary→`--fe-secondary`/`--fe-border`(dark)/cover tint, owner accent→`--fe-accent` (progress/ring/highlights only). No other hues in components. Blue restraint rule: blue fills appear only on primary actions, progress, active nav/level/speed states, and focus; all other surfaces stay canvas/surface with hairline dividers — never a wall of blue cards.

Measured contrast (computed WCAG relative luminance, same method as S1/S3, 2026-10-09; locked by `tests/Feature/S3DesignTest.php` for BOTH themes): light — text/canvas 17.12:1, text/surface 18.15:1, muted/canvas 7.26:1, muted/surface 7.70:1, on-primary/primary 5.44:1, on-primary/hover 4.66:1, on-accent/accent 7.45:1, on-secondary/secondary 10.32:1, text/tint 15.39:1, success/surface 5.47:1, danger/surface 6.47:1; controls: input-border/surface 7.70:1, primary/surface 3.33:1 (focus/non-text PASS). Dark — text/canvas 16.84:1, text/surface 15.41:1, muted/canvas 9.20:1, muted/surface 8.41:1, on-primary/primary 5.63:1, on-primary/hover 8.21:1, on-accent/accent 5.39:1, on-secondary/secondary 8.11:1, text/tint 8.11:1, success/surface 9.83:1, danger/surface 6.80:1; controls: input-border/surface 8.41:1, primary/surface 5.15:1 (focus PASS). White-on-primary-blue deliberately NOT used: light white/primary 3.33:1 and dark white/primary 3.55:1 both FAIL normal text, so both themes use an ink label on primary. No failing pair waived; decorative dividers exempt and never sole indicators.

Theme behavior (APPROVED): three choices `سیستم` (default on first visit) / `روشن` / `تیره`. System follows `prefers-color-scheme` and reacts to OS changes; explicit light/dark persists in `localStorage` (`fe-theme`) and wins on later visits; re-selecting System restores OS-following. Theme applies via `data-theme` on `<html>` from an inline pre-paint script (no flash) and is re-asserted after Livewire navigation. Control lives in Settings only (no duplicate backend); auth/learner/public layouts share the same pre-paint snippet. Code token source stays `resources/css/app.css` (`:root[data-theme]` blocks own every color value; components use only `var(--fe-*)`; test fails on any hex outside the token blocks).

Icon system (APPROVED): one family — Lucide (ISC-licensed, stroke-based) — served as locally bundled inline SVGs through a reusable Blade component (`<x-fe-icon name="…" />`, `resources/views/components/fe-icon.blade.php` — the `fe-` prefix avoids the Filament/heroicons `<x-icon>` registration); no CDN, no emoji/Unicode-sigil substitutes, no second family. Icons carry `aria-hidden` by default; interactive icon buttons always have an accessible name + visible label where the glyph alone is ambiguous + ≥44px target. Sizes 16/20/24 via `size` prop; `stroke-width: 2`, `currentColor`, aligned to text baseline.

Direction for this slice (agent-proposed details, NOT owner approval): thesis — a calm teal reading studio: mist canvas, deep-ink text, one confident blue for action, quiet secondary surfaces; audio feels like studio hardware, text stays editorial. Signature — the composed reader + studio player pair (cover/level/sentences/vocab as one learning environment; compact icon-led player with mini-player above bottom tabs). Motion — ≤200ms press/focus/player-state transitions only; `prefers-reduced-motion` disables all; no autoplay, no permanent animation, no heavy blur/gradients/glow (cover art + landing hero only). Type — Vazirmatn Persian + system English stack unchanged; reader 18–19px/1.8, measure ~680px.

## Owner-supplied brand assets 2026-10-10 (APPROVED files; recorded before coding)

Owner dropped four files in `Logo/` (authoritative input, same palette as the approved theme):

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `fastenglish_header_logo.png` (697×197, transparent) | header lockup (blue speed-FE mark + blue `FAST` + ink `ENGLISH`) — light surfaces |
| `fast_english_logo_black.svg` (monochrome master) | source for the dark-theme header variant (ink pixels recolored to theme text) |
| `fast_english_app_favicon.png` (1024×1024) | app icon master — PWA icons (192/512/maskable/180), favicon, cover placeholder, offline mark |
| `fast_english_color-codes.txt` | confirms the approved Blue/Teal tables (no new colors) |

Mapping (APPROVED): header lockup replaces every `FE` monogram + `Fast English` text brand (learner sidebar/brandbar, public nav, all four auth panels) via one theme-aware `<x-fe-brand>` component (light PNG / generated dark PNG, `role=img` + label, fixed height, width auto). App icon replaces the navy PIL PWA placeholders (same `/icons/*` paths + `apple-touch-icon`, so the manifest/SW allowlist is untouched), becomes `/favicon.ico`, the topic-cover placeholder mark, and the offline-page mark (both icon paths are SW-precached, so they render offline). No other brand art; landing composition still untouched.

Player direction for this slice (agent-proposed details, NOT owner approval): a standard podcast-player stack — title + speed-cycle on the top row, full-width progress seek with real fill, elapsed/total times, centered [−10s][play 64px][+10s] cluster. Speed becomes ONE cycle button (`1 → 1.25 → 1.5 → 0.75 → 1`, always visible `N×` label + gauge icon + live `aria-label`, sticky rate across lessons, keyboard-operable) instead of four pills. Motion stays ≤200ms press/focus only; `prefers-reduced-motion` kills transitions (the fill itself never animates).

## Proposed defaults (NOT owner-approved — reversible)

The following are the scope's §17.1 working proposals. They are defaults for scaffolding and first rendered review, not brand approval:

| Semantic token | Proposed value (§17.1) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| canvas | `#F8FAFC` | PROPOSED |
| surface | `#FFFFFF` | PROPOSED |
| text | `#0F172A` | PROPOSED |
| muted-text | `#475569` | PROPOSED |
| border | `#E2E8F0` | PROPOSED |
| primary | `#1D4ED8` | PROPOSED |
| primary-hover | `#1E40AF` | PROPOSED |
| on-primary | `#FFFFFF` | PROPOSED |
| success | `#15803D` | PROPOSED |
| danger | `#B91C1C` | PROPOSED |

- Typography (PROPOSED): Vazirmatn self-hosted for Persian (license recorded before use); legible system font for English. English body 18px / ~1.75 line-height; main UI controls ≥16px.
- Restraint (binding): no new arbitrary colors, decorative shadows/gradients/glows, or permanent animation. Levels indicated by text + limited tokens — no six loud level colors (§17.1).
- Proposed mobile destinations (PROPOSED, §6): «مطالب» / «ذخیره‌شده‌ها» / «حساب». Placement, payment, settings are sub-paths; admin is not in learner nav.
- Canonical code token source: `resources/css/app.css` (semantic tokens + learner styles). Since S1 the code tokens own the resolved values: `:root` variables `--fe-canvas`, `--fe-surface`, `--fe-text`, `--fe-muted-text`, `--fe-border`, `--fe-primary`, `--fe-primary-hover`, `--fe-on-primary`, `--fe-success`, `--fe-danger`, plus `--fe-font-fa` (self-hosted Vazirmatn variable, `public/fonts/vazirmatn/`, OFL license beside the files) and `--fe-font-en` (system stack). The table above keeps the proposed values and PROPOSED status (unchanged, still not owner approval). Never maintain a second competing palette.
- S1 measured contrast (computed WCAG relative luminance on the actual pairs, 2026-10-08; pairs are the proposals, not approvals): text/canvas 17.06:1, primary/surface 6.70:1, on-primary/primary 6.70:1, success/surface 5.02:1, danger/surface 6.47:1, muted-text/canvas 7.24:1. Every pair measures at or above 4.5:1 for normal text.

## Direction history

- Quiet reading room (S1–S8 working default): text first, one restrained player bar, supporting imagery kept small. SUPERSEDED 2026-10-09 by the owner instruction above; retained here as history. S3/S4/S7/S8 notes below were judged under that thesis.

## Direction — Night Studio (SUPERSEDED 2026-10-09 for the app light theme by the owner-approved Soft Day direction below; dark/sepia tables retained as unapproved history — see open decisions)

- Visual thesis: a night studio — deep ink-blue dark canvas with a warm amber signal for play/progress, editorial reading surfaces in light/sepia; audio controls feel like studio hardware, text stays calm.
- Signature element (proposed): the mini-player + bottom tab bar pair with an amber progress signal, plus deterministic abstract cover art per topic (GD, slug-seeded, no baked text).
- Intentional restraint: one amber accent for primary/progress, one teal for success, one coral for danger; gradients/glow only in cover art and landing hero; motion only for state feedback/transitions with `prefers-reduced-motion` honored; shadows only via named elevation tokens.
- Must never look generic: no interchangeable card-grid marketing look; no dashboard KPI widgets; no stock-photo filler; no ad-hoc colors in components.
- Audience/surface jobs: Persian-RTL learners picking a short English article at a level, reading + listening, resuming later; landing promises one sample, how-it-works, plans, install, FAQ.
- Composition: single column mobile; reading measure ~680px desktop; list = title + level selector + low-noise search + continue-when-valid + newest topics, one card/row per topic (16/9 cover, title, levels, minutes); lesson order title/bounded image → level selector → player → body → key words; account = subscription + current request + one CTA.
- Responsive transformation: bottom tabs + mini-player with safe-area padding (`env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`); end-of-content padding clears fixed controls; reflow at 320 CSS px; review at 360/390/1280 (see D2–D5).
- Motion: no autoplay, no permanent animation; transitions ≤200ms for press/focus/player state only; reduced-motion disables all.
- Content voice: direct Persian chrome, LTR English body; error keeps safe values; success only after server confirmation; color never the sole signal.
- Code mapping (proposed, NOT implemented this turn): `resources/css/app.css` owns tokens as `@theme` variables plus a `[data-theme]` custom variant with per-theme definitions (`dark`, `light`, `sepia`); components use only those variables; no hex literal outside the token block (extends the existing S3DesignTest rule to all three themes).
- Typography (PROPOSED): Persian UI Vazirmatn self-hosted (existing `public/fonts/vazirmatn/`, OFL beside files); English display sans Sora self-hosted under OFL (license file to be recorded at `public/fonts/sora/OFL.txt` before use); English reading serif Newsreader self-hosted under OFL (license at `public/fonts/newsreader/OFL.txt` before use). Roles: Vazirmatn = Persian chrome/labels; Sora = English headings/hero/player numerals; Newsreader = English lesson body/glossary examples. Fallbacks: system-ui stacks. English body 18px/1.75; controls ≥16px.

### Night Studio token tables (every hex PROPOSED until owner approval; ratios measured 2026-10-09 by computed WCAG relative luminance, same method as S1/S3)

### Measured contrast (computed ratios; body ≥4.5:1 PASS, controls/focus/input-boundaries ≥3:1 PASS; decorative dividers exempt, never sole indicators)

Dark (`#0D1526` canvas / `#172033` surface): text/canvas 15.88:1, text/surface 14.18:1, muted/canvas 9.98:1, muted/surface 8.91:1, on-primary/primary 9.08:1, on-primary/hover 10.51:1, success/surface 8.74:1, success/canvas 9.79:1, danger/surface 6.04:1, danger/canvas 6.77:1, primary/canvas 8.93:1 (focus/non-text), primary/surface 7.97:1, input-border `#7A8BB0`/surface 4.76:1 (control boundary). Border `#2A3A55`/canvas 1.59:1 — dividers only, decorative, never the sole control indicator; focus uses primary (≥7:1).

Light (`#FAF6EF` canvas / `#FFFDF8` surface): text/canvas 15.40:1, text/surface 16.32:1, muted/canvas 5.61:1, muted/surface 5.95:1, on-primary/primary 5.02:1, on-primary/hover 7.09:1, success/surface 5.38:1, success/canvas 5.08:1, danger/surface 6.18:1, danger/canvas 5.83:1, primary-as-text/surface 4.94:1, primary-as-text/canvas 4.66:1, primary-focus/surface 4.94:1, input-border `#776B5B`/surface 5.12:1 (control boundary). Border `#E7DFD2`/canvas 1.23:1 — dividers only, decorative; focus uses primary (≥4.6:1).

Sepia (`#F5EBD3` canvas / `#FFF8E7` surface): text/canvas 11.09:1, text/surface 12.42:1, muted/canvas 5.37:1, muted/surface 6.01:1, on-primary/primary 6.70:1, on-primary/hover 8.57:1, success/surface 5.17:1, success/canvas 4.61:1, danger/surface 7.57:1, danger/canvas 6.76:1, primary-as-text/surface 6.70:1, primary-as-text/canvas 5.98:1, input-border `#76644F`/surface 5.35:1 (control boundary). Border `#E3D5B8`/canvas 1.22:1 — dividers only, decorative; focus uses primary (≥5.9:1).

No failing pair waived: all body-text pairs ≥4.5:1, all control/focus/input-boundary pairs ≥3:1 on the listed fills; decorative divider borders are exempt and never sole indicators. Anti-template check: ink-blue + warm-paper + sepia triple with amber-progress/mini-player/abstract-cover signature is product-specific; rejected the generic slate-blue + Inter-default marketing look.

## Direction — Soft Day (owner-approved light theme 2026-10-09; implemented in `resources/css/app.css` this turn)

- Visual thesis: a soft daylight reading room — warm paper canvas, white pill surfaces, one coral signal for primary actions and progress; calm Persian chrome, friendly but adult.
- Signature element: the floating pill topnav (solid surface, soft shadow, no blur) with dark pill CTA, coral primary buttons, and lavender monogram covers on cream.
- Intentional restraint: one coral accent for primary/progress, retained teal/rose for status text only (always with text/icon, never color-alone); soft shadow only via `--fe-elev-1`; transitions ≤200ms for press/focus only; `prefers-reduced-motion` disables all.
- Explicitly excluded by owner order (perf cost): SVG grain overlay, `backdrop-blur` nav, permanent/floating blob animations, giant blurred background blobs.
- Must never look generic: no navy-SaaS blue, no dashboard widgets, no stock-photo filler, no ad-hoc colors outside the table below.
- Palette (every hex owner-approved 2026-10-09; code owns values in `resources/css/app.css :root`):

| Token | Hex (APPROVED 2026-10-09) | Role |
|---|---|---|
| canvas | `#FDFCF8` | app background |
| surface | `#FFFFFF` | cards/bars/inputs |
| text | `#292524` | body |
| muted-text | `#78716C` | secondary (4.67:1 on canvas — thin but PASS, recorded) |
| border | `#E7E5E4` | dividers only, decorative |
| input-border | `#78716C` | input/checkbox/radio boundaries (4.80:1 on surface) |
| primary | `#FFB7B2` | coral fill/progress (dark label 9.15:1) |
| primary-hover | `#FF9E99` | hover/pressed fill (dark label 7.66:1) |
| on-primary | `#292524` | label on coral |
| tint-lavender | `#EFEDF4` | cover-placeholder bg (dark monogram 13.07:1; never muted text) |
| success | `#15803D` | retained status text (5.02:1) |
| danger | `#B91C1C` | retained status text (6.47:1) |
| elev-1 | `0 4px 20px -2px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.05)` | soft shadow only |

- Landing record (APPROVED for future landing work; landing markup untouched this turn): same canvas/surface/text/muted/coral tokens plus sage `#E8EFE8` and lavender `#EFEDF4` screen/tint backgrounds with dark `#292524` text.
- Measured contrast, light (computed WCAG relative luminance, same method as S1/S3, 2026-10-09): text/canvas 14.78:1, text/surface 15.17:1, muted/canvas 4.67:1, muted/surface 4.80:1, on-primary/primary 9.15:1, on-primary/hover 7.66:1, success/surface 5.02:1, danger/surface 6.47:1, input-border/surface 4.80:1 (control boundary), text/primary 9.15:1 (dark focus ring on accent), text/surface 15.17:1 (dark focus ring), text/lavender 13.07:1. Coral `#FFB7B2`/surface 1.66:1 — coral is NEVER body text or a lone boundary; it is fill-with-dark-label only. No failing pair waived.
- Shape language: cards/filters/empty/cover blocks 1.5rem; buttons/inputs/pills/nav links 999px; player bar top corners 1.25rem; floating pill topnav with 1rem side margins (solid surface, soft shadow).
- Focus: 3px dark ring (`--fe-text`) — ≥9:1 on surface, canvas, and accent; never coral-on-white.
- Typography (unchanged this turn): Vazirmatn Persian + system English stay; Outfit/Reenie Beanie deferred (Latin-only glyphs, extra downloads — open decision).
- Motion: explicit no-motion direction beyond ≤200ms press/focus feedback; the existing reduced-motion kill-switch stays.
- Anti-template check: cream + coral + lavender + pill-nav + monogram-cover signature is product-specific; rejected both the generic navy-SaaS look and the superseded ink-blue Night Studio.

## Direction — Editorial Ivory (owner-approved 2026-10-09; reference image is the primary visual direction)

- Visual thesis: a premium editorial learning product — the elegance of a digital magazine with the usability of a modern learning app. Generous whitespace, clear hierarchy, editorial headlines, consistent image crops, readable measures, precise alignment.
- Signature element: the immersive reader — title/cover/level/audio/English text/vocabulary as one designed reading experience — plus the editorial landing hero and the «امروز» continue-learning moment.
- Intentional restraint: one blue for primary actions/active states, one amber as a limited accent (progress, today ring, small highlights); off-white surfaces, subtle separators, controlled borders, restrained shadows; no rainbow badges, glowing borders, decorative charts, oversized empty dashboard sections, or rows of indistinguishable icon-and-text boxes. Every visual element has a clear purpose.
- Palette (hexes are the reference-derived proposals from the owner request; semantic roles APPROVED 2026-10-09; code owns resolved values in `resources/css/app.css :root`):

| Code token | Value | Semantic role |
|---|---|---|
| `--fe-canvas` | `#F7F5EF` | warm ivory app background |
| `--fe-surface` | `#FFFDF8` | clean off-white cards/bars/inputs |
| `--fe-text` | `#172238` | deep navy body text |
| `--fe-muted-text` | `#5B6372` | secondary text (must measure ≥4.5:1 on canvas) |
| `--fe-border` | `#E7DFD2` | subtle separators/dividers only |
| `--fe-primary` | `#4263EB` | blue primary actions + active states |
| `--fe-primary-hover` | `#364FC7` | pressed/hover fill |
| `--fe-on-primary` | `#FFFFFF` | label on blue |
| `--fe-accent` | `#E9AC52` | warm amber accent: progress, today ring, small highlights (never body text alone) |
| `--fe-success` | `#0F766E` | status text (with text/icon, never color-alone) |
| `--fe-danger` | `#BE123C` | status text (with text/icon, never color-alone) |
| `--fe-elev-1/2` | named tokens only | restrained shadows |

- Mapping: reference canvas→`--fe-canvas`, primary text→`--fe-text`, primary actions→`--fe-primary`, limited accent→`--fe-accent`. Supersedes the Soft Day coral/ink tokens for learner + landing surfaces (soft-day table retained above as history). Focus ring uses `--fe-primary` (4.90:1 on surface — PASS as a ≥3:1 control indicator). Amber `#E9AC52` is fill-with-navy-label only (7.93:1); blue `#4263EB` is fill-with-white-label only (4.98:1); neither is body text on surface. No failing pair waived.
- Measured contrast (computed WCAG relative luminance, same method as S1/S3, 2026-10-09, locked by `tests/Feature/S3DesignTest.php`): text/canvas 14.57:1, muted/canvas 5.55:1, text/surface 15.62:1, muted/surface 5.95:1, on-primary/primary 4.98:1, on-primary/hover 6.77:1, on-accent/accent 7.93:1, text/lavender 13.68:1, success/surface 5.38:1, danger/surface 6.18:1; controls: input-border/surface 5.12:1, primary/surface 4.90:1.
- Typography: Vazirmatn for Persian (existing self-hosted `public/fonts/vazirmatn/`, OFL beside files); Inter for English (self-hosted under OFL with license recorded, fallback system stack when unavailable). English reader body 18–19px / ~1.8 line-height, measure ~680px, well-separated paragraphs; Persian chrome per existing scale.
- Layout: mobile-first single column; desktop uses a restrained sidebar (Today/Discover/Words/Account) with a strong content area, same IA as the mobile four-tab bottom bar («امروز»/«کشف»/«واژه‌ها»/«حساب»); saved lessons reachable from Discover/Account; landing/auth/staff stay distinct; no admin navigation for students.
- Required screens: (A) landing with hero + value proposition + start action + editorial image + method + lesson selection + workflow + benefits + real-data plans + FAQ + public sample; (B) «امروز» greeting + Continue Learning + today plan + goal progress + due vocab + recommendations, next action first; (C) «کشف مطالب» editorial library with imagery/titles/metadata/search/pagination/level-category filters, one row per topic, level→version-or-unavailable; (D) immersive reader (title/cover/level/player/LTR text/vocab controls, loading/audio-error/locked/missing-level/empty-vocab states, mobile safe-area clearance); (E) vocabulary notebook + focused Again/Hard/Good/Easy review; (F) calm account/subscription/settings; (G) desktop sidebar layout, not a stretched mobile page.
- Motion: short purposeful transitions (≤200ms) for navigation/interaction state only; `prefers-reduced-motion` disables all; no autoplay.
- Anti-template check: ivory + navy + blue/amber + editorial hero + reader-first composition is product-specific; rejected generic SaaS card walls and dashboard KPI looks.

## Composition and responsiveness

- List page (§17.2): page title, level selector, low-noise search, a "continue" section only when valid progress exists, then newest topics. One card/row per topic (six versions never become six results). Card: fixed-ratio image, title, available levels, estimated time. No badge piles, internal metadata, tables, or finance KPIs.
- Saved page reuses the list pattern (§17.2). Account shows subscription + current request state with one clear CTA.
- Lesson page order (§17.3): title/bounded image → level selector → player → body → key words. No oversized card per paragraph.
- Reader + mini-player must not overlap keyboard, bottom nav, or safe-area; end-of-content padding fits the fixed controls. Speed + bookmark sit in a fixed, understandable spot; controls are not icon-only without names.
- Viewports: 360 / 390 / 430 / 768 / 1440 reviewed; reflow at 320 CSS px for the main path (§17.4). Mobile recomposition, not shrinkage.
- RTL/LTR: chrome `lang=fa dir=rtl`; English body `lang=en dir=ltr` (§17.3). Long FA/EN text and 200% zoom must not break structure.

## Components and states

Required journey states with real data in QA (§17.4): loading, empty, error/retry, locked (premium without access), pending, rejected, expired. Error keeps safe form values; success never shown before server confirmation (§7.4). Color alone never signals error/status.

## Accessibility targets (scope §17.4 — functional target)

- WCAG 2.2 AA on main paths as a working target; full conformance claimed only after a sufficient audit.
- Normal-text contrast ≥ 4.5:1, large text ≥ 3:1 — measured on real pairs, not assumed.
- Touch target design goal 44×44 CSS px; seek usable by keyboard as well as drag.
- Visible focus, logical keyboard order, labels, control names, field-associated errors, status announcements.
- Reduced motion honored; no autoplay. Modals hold and correctly return focus.
- First UI proof gate: list + reader on mobile with real content, inspected as rendered images before full UI build (§17.4).

## Quality budgets

- Accessibility: above. Performance: LCP ≤ 2.5s, INP ≤ 200ms, CLS ≤ 0.1 at p75 unless stricter product budgets are accepted; pre-release lab budget + production RUM/rollout proof required before field claims.
- Reader payload: audio `preload=metadata`; never auto-download all list audio; admin JS/CSS never loaded in learner bundle (scope §20.2).

## Screen acceptance (proof plan; evidence in QUALITY.md)

| Flow | Critical states | Viewports/locales | Visual proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| List + saved | loading, empty, error, locked | 360–430, 768, 1440; fa-RTL | Rendered images inspected (AC-03, AC-18) |
| Lesson reader + player | level switch, missing level, network error | mobile first + desktop measure; en-LTR body | Rendered + browser interaction (AC-04, AC-05, AC-18) |
| Account/subscribe/payment | pending, rejected, expired | mobile | Rendered + server proof (AC-10/11/14, AC-18) |

## Decisions intentionally deferred

Final brand/logo, multi-locale UI (out of v1). Palette/typography above stay PROPOSED until measured approval.

## Open owner decisions (need explicit approval; nothing here blocks save-only turn)

- Palette confirmation: approve or revise every hex in the dark/light/sepia tables.
- Dark companion for Soft Day: Night Studio dark is superseded with no replacement yet; approve a Soft-Day dark palette or defer dark past v1 (amendment 1 still requires dark in v1 — needs a decision).
- Display fonts: Outfit/Reenie Beanie are Latin-only and add downloads; Vazirmatn + system EN stay until owner approves self-hosted OFL fonts with licenses recorded.
- App icons: still navy PIL placeholders; approve a Soft Day icon set before release.
- Sepia mode: confirm the reader-only sepia option ships in v1 or stays deferred.
- Source of licensed photos: owner names the supplier(s) for staff-upload covers; uploads require the license record (source, license name, date checked, usage notes) before publish.

## S3 library note (2026-10-08 — no owner choices; proposals unchanged)

No explicit user style/color choice was given for S3, so nothing is recorded as owner-approved: the §17.1 palette stays PROPOSED and the canonical token source stays `resources/css/app.css` (`:root --fe-*`). The library reuses those tokens only — a test (`tests/Feature/S3DesignTest.php`) fails the build if any color literal appears outside the `:root` block.

- Composition: page title, GET filter form (level select, category select, title search — each with a visible `<label>`), result count, then one card per topic; empty state with a reset link; pagination (12/page) sharing the 44px target rule. Single column on mobile, 2 columns from 640px, 3 from 1024px (recomposition, not shrinkage).
- Card: fixed 16/9 cover (`aspect-ratio: 16/9`, `object-fit: cover`, lazy), English title (`lang=en dir=ltr`), available levels as text, approximate minutes. Cover-less topics show a restrained FE monogram block in canvas/muted tones — no stock imagery.
- Reader additions: bounded cover (`max-height: 15rem`) and the active lesson's glossary only (word LTR bold, Persian meaning, optional LTR example), all escaped.
- Re-measured contrast on the real pairs (computed WCAG luminance, 2026-10-08): text/canvas 17.06:1, muted-text/canvas 7.24:1, text/surface 17.85:1, muted-text/surface 7.58:1, primary/surface 6.70:1, on-primary/primary 6.70:1, success/surface 5.02:1, danger/surface 6.47:1 — every pair ≥ 4.5:1.
- Studio pass: library at 360/390/320 plus desktop 1280 and the reader glossary inspected as rendered pixels (test-results/browser-shots/s3-*.png); quiet reading-room thesis holds; fixture covers are labelled PIL placeholders, not art direction.

## S4 returning-user note (2026-10-08 — no owner choices; proposals unchanged)

No explicit user style/color choice was given for S4, so nothing is recorded as owner-approved: the §17.1 palette stays PROPOSED and the canonical token source stays `resources/css/app.css` (`:root --fe-*`). No new colors or text pairs were introduced — `tests/Feature/S3DesignTest.php` still passes on the same eight pairs (all ≥ 4.5:1).

- Thesis kept: quiet reading room — text first, one restrained player bar, supporting imagery kept small. Signature: the persistent lesson player + level selector pair, now with a mini-player line (`در حال پخش: topic (level)`) in the same bar.
- Top nav: three destinations (مطالب / ذخیره‌شده‌ها / حساب), each a 44 px target, reusing text/border/surface tokens only.
- Saved reuses the library card component (`library/_card.blade.php`) with the single fixed 16/9 media container (`.fe-card-media`); reader keeps the bounded cover + active-lesson glossary only.
- Player bar grows by one mini-player line; end-of-content padding raised 19 rem → 22 rem so the last glossary/body row clears the fixed bar when scrolled to the bottom (proven at 360/390).
- Studio pass: saved + reader at 360/390 plus glossary at 390 inspected as rendered pixels (test-results/browser-shots/s4-*.png); restraint holds, no badge piles or dashboard look.

## S7 placement note (2026-10-09 — no owner choices; proposals unchanged)

No explicit user style/color choice was given for S7, so nothing is recorded as owner-approved: the §17.1 palette stays PROPOSED and the canonical token source stays `resources/css/app.css` (`:root --fe-*`). Placement reuses learner tokens only — question cards, answer options, result panel, and the neutral "در دست آماده‌سازی" state share `.fe-card`/`.fe-btn`/`.fe-filters` styling with no new colors or text pairs. `tests/Feature/S3DesignTest.php` still guards the eight measured pairs (all ≥ 4.5:1). Thesis kept: quiet reading room; signature stays the persistent player + level selector pair — placement adds no second signature, only a restrained question/result sheet in the same measure.

## Slice note — product refinement + landing (agent-proposed details, NOT owner approval)

SUPERSEDED 2026-10-10 for tokens: the Modern Hybrid tables (2026-10-10) are now canonical; Blue/Teal is history. Theme behavior (system default / light / dark persist / pre-paint, OS-following) unchanged. What follows is the agent's reversible visual direction for this slice, recorded before coding per the frontend-design skill:

- Thesis (proposed): a calm teal reading studio you can operate with one thumb — mist canvas, deep-ink text, one confident blue for action; the reader stays editorial while the player behaves like studio hardware.
- Signature (proposed): the compact studio player + editorial landing hero pair — a collapsed mini-bar (play · lesson · speed · expand) that opens into the full seek/skip console, and a landing hero that stages the real reader (sentences + active highlight + speed) instead of marketing art.
- Restraint (proposed): cards only where grouping or purchase interaction requires them (forms, flashcard, continue panel, plan purchase, snapshot); lists (plan tasks, vocab rows, glossary) use quiet divider rows. No gradient blobs, no stock illustration, no floating-card walls, no fabricated testimonials/counts/ratings/claims. Motion is CSS-only entry reveals (staggered ≤8 items) + ≤200ms press/focus/player transitions; `prefers-reduced-motion` disables all and the content renders without JS.
- Player (proposed): single `#lesson-audio` owner unchanged; same IDs (`#player-play/back/forward/seek/speed/current/duration`) so existing proofs keep addressing the same elements. Collapsed shows play + title + compact elapsed/total + speed-cycle + expand toggle; expanded reveals the seek slider + ±10s cluster + status rows. Idle (no lesson) keeps the collapsed bar with play disabled. The bar rests collapsed on first paint at every width (deterministic); the toggle always wins, and errors auto-expand. End-of-content padding follows the state so the bar never covers the last line or the bottom tabs; safe-area insets respected in both states.
- Landing (proposed): own rhythm on shared tokens — hero (eyebrow + H1 + one-line sub + primary CTA to the real public sample + secondary to the library) beside a real-data product preview (sample title/level, three sentences with one active, play + speed row, real cover when present); then how-it-works (3 steps), real sample, real plans (or the honest not-on-sale state), FAQ (3 + link), final CTA. Copy is direct Persian per no-ai-slop; the DRAFT badge is removed because the page is now real.

## S8 public note (2026-10-09 — no owner choices; proposals unchanged)

No explicit user style/color choice was given for S8, so nothing is recorded as owner-approved: the §17.1 palette stays PROPOSED and the canonical token source stays `resources/css/app.css` (`:root --fe-*`). Landing, trust, download, reset, and staff-2FA pages reuse learner tokens only (`.fe-card`/`.fe-btn`/`.fe-field` plus small var-only additions: `.fe-hero`, `.fe-draft-badge`, `.fe-blocked`, `.fe-meta-table`, `.fe-footer`, `.fe-prose`). `tests/Feature/S3DesignTest.php` still passes (same eight pairs, all ≥ 4.5:1; no hex literal outside `:root`). Thesis kept: quiet reading room; signature unchanged — the landing is a short single-measure sheet (promise → sample → how-it-works → plans → install → FAQ) with one restrained DRAFT badge, no marketing hero art, no price claims.

## Mega slice 2026-10-10 — Modern Hybrid + D4 covers (working tree, local-only; no commit/PR)

Owner inputs APPROVED 2026-10-10: (a) single package 299000 toman integer limited-time label, snapshot honored until final decision no auto-timeout, sales OFF until bank+terms, no countdown without real end date; (b) full modern hybrid refresh (dark-bold Today like hybrid-dark, light-soft Reader/Player like hybrid-light, editorial IA Today/Discover/Reader/Words/Account + landing hero + desktop sidebar + Vazirmatn FA + Inter EN + ivory #F7F5EF / navy #172238 / blue #4263EB / amber #E9AC52 base, same `--fe-*` names, old tables history); (c) placement FIXTURE 20Q TEST, no CEFR claim, public exam disabled with preparing + manual-level. No fabrication: no card/holder/bank, terms/privacy, SMTP, domain, keystore, end-date, countdown, counts, testimonials. Fixtures stay TEST.

- Tokens: Hybrid light/dark tables above are canonical; Blue/Teal demoted to history. S3DesignTest locks both themes (11 body + 3 control pairs, same WCAG method) + no-literal rule. Spacing scale, 44px, safe-area, end-padding, no h-scroll 360/390/430/768/1440 + 320 reflow proven via design-theme (7) + s1/s4-mobile (9) + manual 1440 geometry + inspected 390/1360 light+dark. Motion ≤200ms (reveal 180ms) + reduced-motion kill. Inter EN first with system fallback (no admin assets in learner bundle).
- Covers (D4): `App\Support\TopicCover` GD abstract deterministic from slug (800×450, hybrid palette, no baked-text APIs, EXIF stripped via re-encode, no runtime fetch); `App\Support\TopicLicense` enforces staff source+license+date+notes (Checked YYYY-MM-DD real date), GD `covers/gd-*.jpg` exempt; `PublishLesson::topicProblems` refuses publish without cover or without valid staff record. Seeders (S1/S3/S4) use GD only; PIL `s3-cover-fixture.*` remain solely as upload-validation test bytes, never as published covers (D4CoversTest locks no-seeder-reference). Every published fixture topic carries a real file (D4CoversTest). Library cards shot shows GD abstracts, one row per topic, image/title/level/minutes.

## Discover slice 2026-10-10 — premium editorial library (agent-proposed details, NOT owner approval)

No new explicit owner style/color choice was given for this slice, so nothing below is owner-approved: the Modern Hybrid tables above stay canonical and `resources/css/app.css :root[data-theme]` stays the single token source. No new hue is introduced; every addition reuses `var(--fe-*)` (locked by `tests/Feature/S3DesignTest.php` no-literal rule for BOTH themes).

- Thesis (proposed): a premium editorial library — a calm ivory reading room where each topic is one magazine row with real art; one confident blue for action, amber only as a tiny highlight, text stays editorial.
- Signature (proposed): the editorial Discover row — 16/9 cover with a level-chip overlay + EN semibold title (LTR) + muted FA meta (minutes + levels) + pill filters + studio mini-player with a 40px thumb.
- Restraint (proposed): cards keep 20px radius (`1.25rem`) + single soft shadow (`--fe-elev-1`) only; no gradient blobs, no heavy blur, no permanent animation, no stock filler, no badge piles, no blue-card wall, no dashboard widgets.
- Palette/type (proposed): tokens only; EN eyebrow `DISCOVER` in `.fe-display` (uppercase condensed, Persian keeps normal case) + Persian H1 page scale + lede; card title EN 1.125rem/1.5 semibold LTR; meta FA 0.9375rem muted; chips use secondary/tint fills with theme-text labels.
- Composition (proposed): single column mobile, 2 columns from 640px, 3 from 1024px (recomposition, not shrinkage); `.fe-card-media` owns 16/9 with overlay chip top-start; search is an inline pill (`type=search`) + level/category pills are links carrying `?level/category/q/page` so reload/back-forward/share preserve state; empty state with a reset link; pagination is Persian pill (`قبلی`/`بعدی` + numerals, 44px targets).
- Art direction (proposed): GD fallback has 6 deterministic layout variants from the slug hash (`TopicCover::variant` 0–5: bands, horizon, orbits, pillars, diamonds, dots — hybrid palette only, 800×450, no baked-text APIs, EXIF stripped via re-encode, no runtime fetch); staff JPEG/PNG/WebP uploads keep the four-line license record (Source/License/Checked YYYY-MM-DD real date/Notes) enforced at the publish gate; PIL `s3-cover-fixture.*` stay only as upload-validation bytes, never as published covers.
- Motion (proposed): ≤200ms press/focus/player transitions only; `prefers-reduced-motion` kills all; no autoplay; seek fill itself never animates.
- Player shell (proposed): same single `#lesson-audio` owner and IDs; mini shows 40px thumb + 2-line title + play + speed-cycle + expand; expanded centers `[−10s][play 64px][+10s]` (the same play element relocates into the cluster) + full-width seek + LTR times; speed stays ONE cycle `1 → 1.25 → 1.5 → 0.75 → 1` with visible `N×` + live `aria-label`, sticky rate, keyboard-operable.
- Copy (proposed, per no-ai-slop): direct Persian — «کشف مطالب», «یک مطلب کوتاه در سطح خودت پیدا کن», «مطلبی با این مشخصات پیدا نشد», «پاک کردن فیلترها», «حدود X دقیقه»; no invented counts/testimonials/claims.

## Reader slice 2026-10-10 — immersive editorial reader (agent-proposed details, NOT owner approval)

No new explicit owner style/color choice was given for this slice, so nothing below is owner-approved: the Modern Hybrid tables above stay canonical and `resources/css/app.css :root[data-theme]` stays the single token source. No new hue is introduced; every addition reuses `var(--fe-*)` (locked by `tests/Feature/S3DesignTest.php` no-literal rule for BOTH themes).

- Thesis (proposed): a calm ivory reading studio — title, bounded cover, level pills, studio player, LTR sentences with real cue highlight, and key words as one composed learning environment; text stays editorial, audio feels like studio hardware.
- Signature (proposed): the composed reader — EN 600 title (LTR) + muted FA meta + 15rem bounded cover + level pills + sentences with an accent-bar `aria-current` highlight that seeks on select and stops at the interval end, plus vocab rows with a save action in the same measure.
- Restraint (proposed): one blue for primary/active/focus, amber only as the tiny sentence bar and highlights (dark progress included); no gradient blobs, no heavy blur, no permanent animation, no stock filler, no badge piles, no blue-card wall, no word-level highlight.
- Palette/type (proposed): tokens only; reader title EN 1.5rem/1.5 weight 600 LTR; meta FA muted 0.9375rem–1rem; sentences and fallback body 18px/1.8 LTR in a 680px measure; vocab word bold LTR + FA meaning + muted LTR example; focus ring uses primary (both themes ≥3:1).
- Composition (proposed): DOM and visual order stay title → bounded cover → level pills → player → body → key words; cover keeps `max-height: 15rem` with `object-fit: cover` and 20px radius; level pills are links carrying `?level` so reload/back-forward/share preserve state and missing levels show the exact message with available levels (never substituted); the fixed studio player (single `#lesson-audio` owner, same IDs) sits above the tab bar with safe-area and end-padding clearance; vocab lists the active lesson only with a coherent empty state.
- Art direction (proposed): real GD/staff covers only (D4 pipeline, no baked text, no placeholders); Lucide local icons only; no decorative imagery in the reader.
- Motion (proposed): ≤200ms press/focus/player transitions only; `prefers-reduced-motion` kills all; no autoplay; the seek fill itself never animates; sentence auto-scroll uses `block: nearest` and is skipped under reduced motion.
- Copy (proposed, per no-ai-slop): direct Persian — «سطح», «حدود X دقیقه مطالعه», «ادامه از موقعیت ذخیره‌شده», «این درس تکمیل شده است», «ذخیره برای بعد», «خواندم», «واژه‌های کلیدی», «ذخیره واژه», «برای این درس واژه‌ای ثبت نشده است», «همگام‌سازی جمله‌به‌جمله برای این نسخه هنوز آماده نیست؛ پخش عادی فعال است و درس بدون مشکل کامل می‌شود», «این سطح هنوز آماده نیست»; no invented counts/testimonials/claims.

- Composition (proposed): DOM and visual order stay greeting → continue hero → plan divider rows → goal ring → due vocab → recommendations; hero is `cover + head` row (88px thumb, `min-width: 0` wrap, no h-scroll at 320); plan rows open real lessons/review (`reader.show`/`words.review`/`subscribe.index`); goal ring 5rem with `role=img` + Persian label; recommendations reuse `library._card` with real GD/staff covers.
- Art direction (proposed): real covers only (D4 pipeline, `/storage/{cover_path}`, no placeholders, no stock filler); Lucide local icons only (`sun`/`play`/`file-text`/`check`/`languages`/`compass`/`book-open`/`clock`); no decorative imagery.
- Motion (proposed): ≤200ms press/focus transitions only; `prefers-reduced-motion` kills all; no autoplay; seek fill never animates.

- Thesis (proposed): a calm premium notebook that reads like the Reader — ivory measure, quiet divider rows for the list, one solid card for review; text stays editorial, review stays focused with no flashcard rainbow.
- Signature (proposed): the quiet vocab row — EN word LTR bold + FA meaning + muted LTR example + lesson-context link — paired with the single solid review card (big EN word, hidden-then-shown meaning, four calm grade buttons).

Broken baseline inspected: test-results/browser-shots/s8-landing-390.png (thin hero, no workflow/benefits, install before FAQ).

- Thesis (proposed): a premium editorial hero that sells by staging the real product — promise + start CTA beside a real-data reader preview (sample title/level, 3 real sentences with one active, play + speed row, real GD cover), then how-it-works, real sample, featured, workflow, benefits, real-data plans, FAQ, final CTA, install.
- Signature (proposed): the staged real reader + solid final CTA pair — hero preview (cover + EN title LTR + muted FA meta + 3 LTR sentences + play/track/1×) beside eyebrow/H1/one-line sub + pill primary (/sample) + outline secondary (/app); final CTA repeats sample-first with account-second in one solid card.
